# What's Worth Pursuing

Eventually we all have enough money to not really worry about money. Eventually we have families, loved ones, happiness and health.
What do we do after that?
I want to learn and participate in the things that I find fascinating.
Things that can supply adrenaline.
My time is limited; might as well do what I enjoy.
Through this selfish desire to fulfill my own pleasure I may even stumble across something big enough to affect real progress for humanity.

The most interesting areas & people to me right now:

1. Applied AI -> AI researchers
2. Investments, markets, valuation of public and private companies -> VCs, hedge fund managers, analysts and quants
3. Crypto for finance -> Devs who work on the edge of crypto

They are all winners at life.
