1. Do something you enjoy, e.g. go for a bike ride when the weather is nice, stop by a park for a rest and read a book with a cup of coffee.
2. 100 movements; can mix and match any exercise, each exercise has a conversion rate to a "movement", e.g.
    - 1 pushup = 1 movement
    - 2 karate kicks = 1 movement
    - 10 jump ropes = 1 movement
    
    and so on.
3. Use a very large drinking bottle, fill it with water, and chug the bottle when you next see it.
